<h2> Welcome to Conway's Game of Life visualization! </h2>

<p>This program allows you to see what the game of life is like, forming patterns , allowing you to view different patterns through custom input.</p>

<p><b>Hover </b>the tiles you wish to start off as "life". 0 represents a dead cell, and a 1 represents a live cell, have fun! </p>

<h2>Description of the game</h2>

<p> The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
 
  <li> Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours survives </li>
  <li> Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell. </li>
  <li> Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours die of suffocation, and lesser than 2 live neighbours die of underpopulation</li>
